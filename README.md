## Patch Management Guide

This repository provides information and resources related to patch management processes.

**What is Patch Management?**

Patch management is the ongoing process of updating and maintaining software applications and operating systems with the latest security patches and bug fixes. It's a crucial practice for enhancing system security by addressing vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

**Patch Management Process**

The patch management process typically involves eight key stages:

1. **Identification:** Identifying vulnerabilities in your systems through vulnerability scanning or vendor notifications.
2. **Prioritization:** Prioritizing identified vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact.
3. **Testing:** Testing patches in a non-production environment to ensure they don't introduce new issues.
4. **Deployment:** Deploying approved patches to production systems.
5. **Verification:** Verifying that patches have been applied successfully and addressed the vulnerabilities.
6. **Monitoring:** Continuously monitoring systems for new vulnerabilities and ensuring patch effectiveness.
7. **Documentation:** Documenting the entire patch management process for future reference and audit purposes.
8. **Adaptation:** Adapting the process based on lessons learned and evolving security threats.

**Patch Management Activities**

This section can be further expanded upon if you have specific scripts or tools related to patch management activities (Optional):

* Vulnerability Scanning
* Patch Deployment Automation

**Security Measures**

While patching is essential, a layered security approach is recommended. Here are some proactive security measures to prevent vulnerabilities:

* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan systems for vulnerabilities.
* **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.
* **Software Updates:** Keep software up-to-date with the latest security patches.

**Patch Application Timeline**

The recommended timeline for applying patches can vary depending on the severity of the vulnerability and the industry you operate in. Here's a guideline for Banking and Non-Banking sectors:

**Banking** | **Timeline**
---|---|
Critical | Patch within 15-20 days
High | Patch within 25-30 days
Medium | Patch within 45 days
Low | Patch within 60 days

**Non-Banking** | **Timeline**
---|---|
Critical | Patch within 20-25 days
High | Patch within 25-30 days
Medium | Patch within 60 days
Low | Patch within 90 days

**Key Terms**

* Risk Reduction
* Prioritization of Mitigation
* RAD (Remediate, Analyze, Deploy)
* RED (Remediate, Educate, Deploy)

**Resources**

* Consider adding links to helpful external resources related to patch management best practices, tools, or vendor information (Optional).


By following these guidelines and best practices, you can establish a robust patch management process to enhance the security of your IT environment.
