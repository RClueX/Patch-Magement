This repository provides information and resources related to patch management processes.

**What is Patch Management?**

Patch management is the ongoing process of updating and maintaining software applications and operating systems with the latest security patches and bug fixes. It's a crucial practice for enhancing system security by addressing vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

---

**Patch Management Process**

The patch management process typically involves eight key stages:

1. **Identification:** Identifying vulnerabilities in your systems through vulnerability scanning or vendor notifications.
2. **Prioritization:** Prioritizing identified vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact.
3. **Testing:** Testing patches in a non-production environment to ensure they don't introduce new issues.
4. **Deployment:** Deploying approved patches to production systems.
5. **Verification:** Verifying that patches have been applied successfully and addressed the vulnerabilities.
6. **Monitoring:** Continuously monitoring systems for new vulnerabilities and ensuring patch effectiveness.
7. **Documentation:** Documenting the entire patch management process for future reference and audit purposes.
8. **Adaptation:** Adapting the process based on lessons learned and evolving security threats.

**Patch Management Activities**

**•	Corrective Actions:**

This refers to applying patches that fix vulnerabilities in software. Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access to systems or data. Patching these vulnerabilities is essential for maintaining a secure IT environment.

---

**•	Compensatory Controls:**

While patching is ideal, it may not always be immediately possible. Compensative controls are temporary measures put in place to mitigate risks while a permanent fix (patch) is being deployed. These controls can include things like restricting access to vulnerable systems or deploying additional security software.

---

**•	Security Measures:**

These are proactive steps taken to prevent vulnerabilities from arising in the first place. Security measures include vulnerability scanning, using strong passwords, and keeping software up to date.

**Patch Application Timeline**

The recommended timeline for applying patches can vary depending on the severity of the vulnerability and the industry you operate in. Here's a guideline for Banking and Non-Banking sectors:

**Banking** | **Timeline**
---|---|
Critical | Patch within 15-20 days
High | Patch within 25-30 days
Medium | Patch within 45 days
Low | Patch within 60 days

**Non-Banking** | **Timeline**
---|---|
Critical | Patch within 20-25 days
High | Patch within 25-30 days
Medium | Patch within 60 days
Low | Patch within 90 days
